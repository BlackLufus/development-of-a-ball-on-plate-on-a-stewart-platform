# Ball on an inclined plane

This section describes the physical behavior of a ball on an inclined plane, i.e., a sloped platform. This model is crucial for accurately understanding the ball's motion behavior and later developing suitable control algorithms.

## Forces acting on the ball

For the analysis, we first consider the fundamental forces acting on the ball.
 
### Gravitational force

```math
F_G = m \cdot g
```

### Slope driving force

```math
F_H = F_G \cdot \sin(\theta) = m \cdot g \cdot \sin(\alpha)
```

### Normal force

```math
F_N = F_G \cdot \cos(\alpha) = m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha)
```

### Frictional force

```math
F_R = \mu \cdot F_N = \mu \cdot m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha)
```

## Torque

Previous calculations have treated the body as a kind of sliding block.  In reality, however, the ball behaves differently because it does not slide but rolls. As a result, static friction does not act purely as a braking force but  provides the torque necessary to set a ball in rotation.

### Moment of inertia

The moment of inertia describes how difficult it is to set a ball in rotation.

**Hollow sphere**

```math
J = \frac{2}{3} \cdot m \cdot r^2
```

**Solid sphere**

```math
J = \frac{2}{5} \cdot m \cdot r^2
```

### Rotation equation

The rolling motion results in torque generated by static friction.

```math
M = F_r \cdot r
```

According to Newton's second law of rotation, the following applies:

```math
M = J \cdot \alpha
```

Where α is the angular acceleration
 
```math
\alpha = \frac{a}{r}
```

When rolling, therefore, the following applies:

```math
F_r \cdot r = J \cdot \frac{a}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad F_r = \frac{J}{r^2} \cdot a
```

## Summary of the forces at work

The acceleration equation is derived using Newton's second law: sum of all forces acting = mass × acceleration. The following forces are taken into account for the equation:

```math
F_H - F_R - F_r = m \cdot a
```

so

```math
m \cdot a = m \cdot g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot m \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha) - \frac{J}{r^2} \cdot a
```

First, the equation is divided by the mass m.

```math
a = g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha) - \frac{J}{m \cdot r^2} \cdot a
```

The coefficient of friction is then applied. For a solid sphere, the following moment of inertia applies

```math
J = \frac{2}{5} \cdot m \cdot r^2
```

If the equation is substituted for J, the mass and radius of the sphere cancel out, leaving effectively a numerical factor.

```math
\frac{\frac{2}{5} \cdot m \cdot r^2}{m \cdot r^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{2}{5}
```

so

```math
a = g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha) - \frac{2}{5} \cdot a
```

Finally, a term with the acceleration remains.

```math
a + \frac{2}{5} \cdot a = g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{7}{5} \cdot a = g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha)
```

Finally, the equation is multiplied by the factor, leaving a final equation.

```math
a = \frac{5}{7} \cdot (g \cdot \sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot g \cdot \cos(\alpha)) \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = \frac{5}{7} \cdot g \cdot (\sin(\alpha) - \mu \cdot \cos(\alpha))
```

The derived acceleration formula precisely describes the motion of a massive, homogeneous sphere on an inclined plane, taking into account rotation and friction. Sufficiently high static friction µs is required for pure rolling. This is the only way to ensure that no slippage occurs and that the ball accelerates without sliding.

```math
a = \frac{5}{7} \cdot g \cdot \sin(\alpha)
```
